# Introduction

In today's world of IT automation, it might be hard to choose which tool you should learn first. Should you start with provisioning using Ansible, Chef or Puppet? Or, how about starting out with the heavy-hitter and learn Terraform or OpenTofu? In reality it comes down as to where you want to focus the most.
