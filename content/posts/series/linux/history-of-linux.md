## Introduction

Welcome to the first part in the Linux series. In this post, we will be covering the long and interesting history 
that makes up the Linux operating system. We will cover the most important parts from the creation of the GNU Project
to the rise in importance of Linux among the server market. 

I believe that knowing the history of any project is the half of battle. In the case of Linux, the battle is anything but 
boring. For those wanting to enter the Systems Administration, DevOps, or Development market, the days of yore for this 
OS are a must read.
