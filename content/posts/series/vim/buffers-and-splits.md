## Introduction

Hello everyone, and welcome back to the final entry in the vim series. In this post we will be talking 
about buffers, splits and some helpful options in command mode. Now, this information is going to be a 
bit advanced. However, we'll look at this topic in more bite sized chucks to make the content easier to 
understand. With that said let's get started. 

## What are Buffers?

The definition that you need to comprehend is the namesake of this article, *Buffers*. 

*Buffers hold the content read from a file inside a chuck of memory.* 

The allocated chuck of memory is what vim displays in front of you when you open the program. This makes it 
so that if vim were to crash, your original file would be safe from corruption. Another added benefit of opening
files in memory is that multiple splits are able to view that bit of memory at the same time. For more information, 
be sure to check out [Vim Wiki's](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Buffers) section on buffers. 

## Playing with Buffers
