## Introduction
In today's IT infrastructure, it is more than likely that you will run into Cloud technologies in your workplace. Cloud allows for companies to save money by reducing operating cost and off-loading the cost of physical servers to the cloud provider. In this series, I'll be covering information for the AZ-900, the entry level certification for Microsoft's cloud provider, Azure. 

The AZ-900 covers the basics of what every Azure Cloud Administrator should know. According to Microsoft's Official Study Guide [^1], the exam covers topics:
- Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)
    - Describe cloud computing
    - Describe the benefits of using cloud services
    - Describe cloud service types
- Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)
    - Describe the core architectural components of Azure
    - Describe Azure compute and networking services
    - Describe Azure storage services
    - Describe Azure identity, access, and security
- Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)
    - Describe cost management in Azure
    - Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance
    - Describe features and tools for managing and deploying Azure resources
    - Describe monitoring tools in Azure

In this post, we'll cover some basic introductory knowledge, like:
- Azure Portal [^2]
- Azure Command Lines [^2]
    - Azure CLI
    - Azure Powershell
    - Azure Cloud Shell
- ARM Templates
- Azure Advisor


## Azure Portal
To start, we'll go over what you'll be engaging with on a regular basis, the Azure Portal.    

![Azure Portal](/images/posts/series/az-900/day-01/image-1.png)

This is the web front end where you will manually interact with any of the Azure Services. Not only that, but the portal allows for some customization with personal dashboards, layouts, workflows and the like. You will also use the portal to engage with Access Controls, Cost Management and to get updates on the platform.

To access the Azure Portal, you'll need to have a Microsoft Account and then go to [portal.azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free) to register for an account. Its here that you'll have the option to try some popular Azure Services for free up to 12 months and get a $200 credit for 30 days. You can even access the Azure Portal from your phone using the Android or iOS app. Here you can do most of what you can do through the web interface. Go ahead and try it out!

## Azure Command Lines
Next up, there are the command lines that accompany Azure. The command lines shown here allow an Adminstrator or Developer to interact with Azure without having to the mess around with web interface. These include:
- Azure CLI
- Azure Powershell
- Azure Cloud Shell
