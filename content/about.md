Hello reader, my name is Kyle "WeiseGuy" Weise or WG for short. I am but a simple Sys Admin just 
trying to survive the woefully ever-changing market of IT. Join me on my journey of forever 
discovery in the fields of Computer Science, Security, Administration, and anything 
else I find interesting this week. I promise that you won't regret it! 

\- WG
